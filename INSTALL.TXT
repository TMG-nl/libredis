The project has been adapted to support autconf/automake builds

== C Library ==

autoreconf --install
./configure
make 
make install

# To create a distributable (with a filled changelog and everything) run make dist-gzip
# This tar.gz can be used in conjunction with a gentoo ebuild i.e.

== PHP Extension ==

cd php/ext/libredis
phpize
./configure
make 
make install

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The old way of compiling as documented below can still be used by moving Makefile.old to 
Makefile and following below procedures

To install libredis C library

== PHP EXTENSION ==

sudo make php_ext 

(sudo is needed because it will try and install in php extension dir.)

== C Library ==

make libredis

(which will leave 'libredis.so' in the lib dir)

== Multithreading support ==

Multithreading support is enabled by default. In case libredis is never used
concurrently by multiple threads, it is possible to disable it by setting the
environmental variable SINGLETHREADED=1 when running make. This can result in
better performance by making the library not thread-safe.

enjoy.
